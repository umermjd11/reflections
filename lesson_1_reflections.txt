How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
Well, that was pretty fast while using diff command. If we do not go for diff tool, it would be quiet tedious to go throgh the thousand lines of code while bug was just in one line.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
since coding involves logic there should be logical versioning system which can only be done manually with programmers instinct.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
again programming requirements

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
see all commits and see diff between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
well it is very awesome we can undo the changes just by a single line

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
development, progrmming
